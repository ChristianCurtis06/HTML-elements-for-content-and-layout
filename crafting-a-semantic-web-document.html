            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a grappling-based martial art and combat sport that emphasizes ground fighting, leverage, and technique to control and submit opponents, often through joint locks and chokeholds. The term "jiu-jitsu" derives from the Japanese words "ju" (gentle) and "jutsu" (art or technique), meaning "gentle art." It emphasizes using an opponent's strength and movement against them rather than relying on brute force.</p>
            <h3>Origins:</h3>
            <p>BJJ originated in Japan and evolved in Brazil in the early 20th century. It was introduced to Brazil by Mitsuyo Maeda, a Japanese judoka and martial artist, who taught the principles of judo and jiu-jitsu to the Gracie family. The Gracies, particularly Carlos and Helio Gracie, adapted these techniques to suit smaller, weaker practitioners, creating a system that prioritized ground fighting and positional control. Over the decades, BJJ gained popularity through the Gracie familyâ€™s challenges and its prominence in mixed martial arts (MMA).</p>
            <h3>Description of the Martial Art:</h3>
            <p>BJJ is unique for its focus on grappling and submissions. Practitioners aim to take their opponent to the ground, establish dominant positions, and use techniques like armbars, triangle chokes, and rear-naked chokes to secure victory. It also includes a strong emphasis on positional hierarchy, such as mount, guard, and side control. Training often involves sparring (known as rolling), which allows practitioners to test their techniques in a safe, controlled environment. Known for its inclusivity and effectiveness, BJJ is practiced worldwide for self-defense, sport, and fitness, fostering physical strength, mental discipline, and camaraderie among its practitioners.</p>
